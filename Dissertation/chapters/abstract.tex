There are many different ways of implementing a system for synchronisating two or more simulation instances. Throughout this dissertation, the options that exist for real-time application development without the need for a central server will be investigated. Many different issues may be encountered when such a solution is chosen and this dissertation will discuss these issues and their potential solutions.
Examples of netcode from current games is investgated and analysed. Networking tools available in UNITY have also been experimented with through a small side-project.
The development project involves creating a C++ library with functionality for server-less networking. The design and implementation process of a networking library is documented and said library is used to test networking issues such as jitter in client hosted connections. The results and analysis of the tests are provided along with the library code. The conclusion also holds ideas for additional work that could be done in the future to further the project.
