abstract="Currently, web-based online gaming applications are predominately utilising Adobe Flash or Java Applets as their core technologies. These games are often casual, two-dimensional games and do not utilise the specialist graphics hardware which has proliferated across modern PCs and Consoles. Multi-user online game play in these titles is often either non-existent or extremely limited. Computer games applications which grace the current generation of consoles and personal computers are designed to utilise the increasingly impressive hardware power at their disposal. However, these are commonly distributed using a physical medium or deployed through custom, proprietary networking mechanisms and rely upon platform-specific networking APIs to facilitate multi-user online game play. In order to unify the concepts of these disparate styles of gaming, this paper presents two interconnected systems which are implemented using Java Web Start and JXTA P2P technologies, providing a platform-independent framework capable of deploying hardware accelerated cross-platform, cross-browser online-enabled Java games, as part of the Homura Project.",

%The other major advantage of having one player act as the "host" is that we do not have to worry about synchronizing the data on every playerâ€™s machine with every other machine. Instead, we can focus on every player being synchronized with the game data on the "host" machine.

%If one player acts as the "host" of the game, we can significantly reduce the burden on the other players, while only slightly increasing the burden on the player that is the host. Each player sends data to the host, who compiles all the data into one large packet, and then sends a copy to each "client." The advantage of this approach is that if the "host" has a faster connection, that person can support a game containing several low-speed players.
