    \faCheckCircle & There are no additional costs to the publisher/developer when releasing the game. \\
    \faCheckCircle & Players in remote locations can play together with low latency. \\
    \faCheckCircle & The codebase is relatively easily transferable to a central server model if the need arises. \\
    \  & \  \\
    \faTimesCircle & The host player has neglegible ping to the server. This could be a large advantage.  \\
    \faTimesCircle & The host player is likely to use a consumer grade connection increasing the risk of packet loss and high latency \\
    \faTimesCircle & The host player could be using WiFi to host the game which could significantly increase the chance of packet loss. \\
    \faTimesCircle & The host's hardware may not be powerful enough to calculate each simulation step within an accptable tick rate. \\
    \faTimesCircle & If the host player is disconnected mid-game, a host migration will have to take place pausing the game for a few seconds or causing the game to finish unexpectadly. \\
    \faTimesCircle & The host player can see the IP address of each other player that they are playing with. \\
    \faTimesCircle & Cheating could be easy if the host player sends malicious packets to the clients pretending to be the game server.
