    \faCheckCircle & Hardware is likely to be powerful enough to handle the stress of many simulations running simultaneously. \\
    \faCheckCircle & High bandwidth connection is likely to be used. Minimises the chance of high latency and network issues. \\
    \faCheckCircle & Ping to the server is likely to be similar for all players making the game more fair.  \\
    \faCheckCircle & No client can see the address of any other client. \\
    \faCheckCircle & The developer has a lot of control over what is allowed within the game. This allows for anti-cheating systems that are hard to bypass. \\
    \faTimesCircle & Expensive to rent out or buy and maintain server space. Letting players rent out servers makes the game more expensive for them. \\
    \faTimesCircle & Many servers have to be spread out evenly throughout the world to allow for low latency connections.  \\
    \faTimesCircle & People living in remote locations may not have low latency access to official servers.
