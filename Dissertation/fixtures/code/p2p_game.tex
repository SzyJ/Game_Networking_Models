\textbf{startP2PGame() returns:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A positive error code once the game instance has been completed successfully.

\item A negative error code if not enough client info has been received from the session host or if the game has finished ungracefully. The error code will differ based on what error has occured so that it can be identified and dealt with.
\end{itemize}
