%The other major advantage of having one player act as the "host" is that we do not have to worry about synchronizing the data on every playerâ€™s machine with every other machine. Instead, we can focus on every player being synchronized with the game data on the "host" machine.

%If one player acts as the "host" of the game, we can significantly reduce the burden on the other players, while only slightly increasing the burden on the player that is the host. Each player sends data to the host, who compiles all the data into one large packet, and then sends a copy to each "client." The advantage of this approach is that if the "host" has a faster connection, that person can support a game containing several low-speed players.
