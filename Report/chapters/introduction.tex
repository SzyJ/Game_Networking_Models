\chapter{Introduction}
Throughout this project, I will be exploring the different methods of providing a synchronised, multiplayer gaming experiance on two or more computers on a network. I will be covering the networking basics of how two game clients running on seperate machines can communicate with each other as well as exploring the relevant details of how and why the networking systems in games are designed the way they are.


I will explore the existing methods of writing an online multiplayer game from scratch and aim to provide an implementation of a networking library for online games to communicate without a central server. I also aim to provide analysis of efficieny of different methods of achieving this goal.

\section{Basic concepts and Terminolory}
First of all, I will define some basic concepts and terminolory that will be used throughout this document.
\\
\\
\textbf{Client:} Within the context of this document, a client can be defined as a piece of software responsible to running the game (i.e. game client). A client can also be defined as a computer interacting with a server, however it is possible to run two different instances of a game client on a single machine.
\\
\\
\textbf{Online Multiplayer Game:} A video game can be defined as a simulation of a certain scenario that can be manipulated by the player of the game. When talking about online multiplayer games, it can be thought of as a simulation that runs on several clients connected by a network (e.g. LAN or the Internet) that is to be synchronised. When one player performs an action that effects the state of the simulation, this action should also be seen by all participants of this perticular simulation instance and therefore the simulation should remain in the same state across all participating clients.
\\
\\
\textbf{Ping:} In network connections, the ping between different clients refers to the shortest amount of time that is needed for one client to send information to another and receive a response from this client. One client sends a ``ICMP echo request'' to another networked client (e.g. a game server). The receiving client, then responds with an ``ICMP echo reply'' back to the original device. The time between sending the request and receiving the reply, is the ping between the two clients.
\\
\\
\textbf{Lag:} The grater the ping between two connected clients, the bigger the difference in the state of each clients' simulation once an action to be synchronised is performed. When a change is made by one client, this change should be seen by other clients participating in the same simulation and lag occurs when this change does not appear instentaneous to the user.
